- [[2]] - "Where was Henry? Ah, he was standing by her"
- [[4]] - "I remember clearly, perhaps because I ought to have my wits about me for another purpose, how Sir Roland’s father, Sir Weedon, once saw Henry taking the part of Lesurques and mixed him up with Le Cirque d’Hiver."
- [[5]] - "Henry, the angel, was plying his intended fifth with Emperor’s Peg—equal parts of vitriol and applejack in his case—at the top of the ruined lighthouse."
- [[11]] - "If Henry had been there he could have told me what to do."
- [[13]] - "Henry was now stooping over the other body, whistling between its teeth."
- [[14]] - "At my sign, Henry stooped and made all clean again."
- [[16]] - "Should I make an effort and go back to Henry? He was ready to love."
- [[19]] - "Usually he just said William Sydney Porter (O. Henry), which I offended"
- [[21]] - "To reckon with Henry! That was never easy. Just beyond the laurels, I turned sharply and there he was, bending over the body of his latest victim. There was blood all about. I called to him sharply and he seemed dazed."
- [[26]] - "The girl had left Henry by this time, thank God. She was an obvious whey-face. She didn’t seem capable for a moment of understanding those first two killings of his."
- [[31]] - "And again, in this very place for another reason, Henry would remember."
- [[32]] - "Henry had also gone to-day ; poor Henry, who had stayed uncomfortably after his meeting with Clément yesterday."
- [[35]] - "For this time being, Henry was drawing towards a close. I was not sorry. The police were after him in no uncertain manner, and it seemed impossible for him to ultimately escape them."
- [[36]] - "Henry was always made up too. He had buried the corpse ; only the eyes showed."
- [[41]] - "But it was not till my marriage with Henry that old Charles Goodfellow dared to hint that I was going gay."
- [[42]] - " I had let Henry guide me."
- [[44]] - "And this made it difficult to adequately appreciate Henry’s problem." "But I must, I felt, at all costs get back to Henry. The position was this : the second wife’s brother had begun to suspect. He had found a half-burned marriage certificate in the incinerator ; that was charred lines on Henry."
- [[46]] - "how I detested being called Hal"
- [[47]] - "Got me, that is a terrible conjunction of two little words ; Henry does not like it at all."
- [[49]] - "I was developing a bit of a yen for Henry, though this was my first introduction to him."
- [[58]] - "Henry, though a bit on the spectacular side—to fly the viscera of his third, of the old family lawyer, at his small flagstaff, a little argued the exhibitionist—was sane enough."
- [[60]] - "I gave the huddle farewell, and forbade Henry, my peerless investigator, to pursue the matter further."
- [[71]] - "Henry, before our tea of anchovy toast and various hot dishes (I was never a stinter) riotously displayed himself all over me."
- [[76]] - "Those little golden escapes, those logical thoughts, came on me like stars upon some gloomy grove, as Henry said."
- [[77]] - "Though I was alone again, it took me a few minutes to visualise Henry’s predicament with the detached calm which it deserved. "
- [[85]] - "I put Henry’s keenness a few inches below the withered salt-cellar. I drove Henry home, and left him."
- [[86]] - "Henry, I supposed, was about his business and concern, such as it was."
- [[87]] - "I follow his gaze and see, as Henry saw when he was at home in Woodstock, twisted trees in front of the thick-windowed little house"
- [[91]] - "It looked, though, as if Henry had been playing about with this exhibit."
- [[92]] - "I wondered what Henry would think of next."
- [[94]] - "And Henry was waiting for me."
- [[100]] - "I had worked for him, Henry had worked for him."
# Notes

- Married at least 3 times and may have killed one or more wives:
	- "That old aunt of his third wife had turned up again. Strangely enough a jellyfish had plugged the solution of her motor boat’s continuity. And there she was back again, alert, suspicious, very much alive." [[77]]
- Killed #ThomasHardy 
	- "Some Tom, not the one I killed in the matter of Jasmine, had done that, I gathered." [[46]]
