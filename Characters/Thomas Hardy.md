- [[46]] - "Some Tom, not the one I killed in the matter of Jasmine, had done that, I gathered."
- [[65]] - "I started to read Hardy’s exquisite production, and every muscle of my brain was enthralled until I came to the end."
- [[88]] - "I had got a little sick, too, of the way they went on ; like that Tom and Flora’s Jasmine."
