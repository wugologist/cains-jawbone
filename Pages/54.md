I was feeling about as good as man could feel that day. Everything horticultural, in the awful and literal sense of the word, was lovely. Green blood, as I considered before breakfast, I delighted to conserve. I received a letter from Miss Doncaster over the crumbs of toast and the last clear smear of marmalade, telling me that the old man would be coming to-day, on her advice to take mine. I admit that she had stirred me strangely. I lit a Nestor and considered her letter once more. To pestle a poisoned poison behind his crimson lights. That was a nice thing to ask of a comparative stranger. It would have to be scanned. Poor old man ; but everyone must bump up against his Waterloo, and to-day was the day of the meeting at La Belle Alliance. It was not appropriate.
# Notes
- La Belle Alliance was an inn near the Battle of Waterloo (June 18 1815)

- "And Sleep must lie down armed, for the villainous centre-bits/Grind on the wakeful ear in the hush of the moonless nights,/While another is cheating the sick of a few last gasps, as he sits/To pestle a poisoned poison behind his crimson lights."
