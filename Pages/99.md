# Notes
- Frederick the Great died 17 August 1786
	- "... whose name among strangers was King Frederick II, or Frederick the Great of Prussia, and at home, among the common people, who much loved and esteemed him, was Valer Fritzï--Father Fredï--a name of familiarity which had not bred contempt in that instance."
